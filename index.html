            It premotes a "Hedonic treadmill" where the temporary happiness from
            new purcheses fades quickly, leading to a cycle of chronic

    <h3>A Deceptive Approach</h3>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Proposing to address the pink tax by increasing prices for men's
          products is an approach that is deceptive but it misframes the issue.</li>
        <li>The line of reasoning leads to deflect from the core problem of gender-based price discrimination
          against women. By suggesting men should also pay more, it shifts the
          focus from the reality that women are being systematically overcharged
          to a hypothetical scenario of universal overpricing. </li>
        <li>The idea absolves manufacturers and retailers of their
            responsibility for setting discriminatory prices and turns a clear issue
            of injustice into a confusing debate about "fairness" for all.</li>
        <li>The true objective of eliminating the pink tax is to achieve price equity and end
              discriminatory practices, not to ensure that both genders are equally
              exploited by inflated costs.</li>
